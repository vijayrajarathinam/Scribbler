                Node.js treats each JavaScript file as a separate module. For instance: if you have a file containing some code and this file is named xyz.js: then this file is treated as a module in Node, and you
can say that you've created a module named xyz Let's take an example to understand this better. You have a file named circle.js which consists of the logic for calculating the area & the
circumference of a circle of a given radius. You can call circle.js file a module named circle. You might be wondering why is there a need to have multiple modules? You could have just
written all the code m a single module. Well: it is very important to write modular code. By modular: I mean to say that your code should be independent and should be loosely coupled.
Imagme that there's a large application and you have all your code Ivritten injust one place: just one file. Too messy: right? How does the code written inside a module run? Before executing
the code v,Titten inside a module: Node takes the entire code and encloses it within a function Ivrapper. The syntax of this function wrapper is: The entire code v,Titten inside a module is
private to the module, unless explicitly stated (exported) othemvise. This is the most significant advantage of having modules in Node.js. Even if you define a global variable in a module using
var: let or const keywords: the variables are scoped locally to the module rather than bemg scoped globally. This happens because each module has a function wrapper of Its oun and the code
written inside one function is local to that function and cannot be accessed outside this function. Imagine that there are two modules — A and B. The code 'Mitten inside the module A is
enclosed wlthm the function wrapper corresponding to the module A. Similar thing happens With the code 'Mitten inside the module B. Because the code pertammg to both the modules is
enclosed within different functions: these functions Will not be able to access the code of each other. (Remember each function in JavaScript has its own local scope?) This is the reason why
moduleA cannot access the code 'Mitten inside module B and vice-versa. The five parameters — exports: require: module: filename: .dlrname are available inside each module in Node.
Though these parameters are global to the code within a module yet they are local to the module (because of the function Ivrapper as explained above). These parameters provide valuable
information related to a module. Let's revisit the circle module: which you looked at earller. There are three constructs defined m this module — a constant variable PI, a function named
calculateArea and another function named calculateC1rcumference. An Important point to keep m mmd is that all these constmcts are private to the circle module by default. It means that you
cannot use these constructs in any other module unless explicitly specified. So: the question that anses now is how do you specify something in a module that can be used by some other
module? This is when the module & require parameters of the function wrapper are helpful. Let's discuss these two parameters in this afflcle. module The module parameter (rather a keyword
in a module in Node) refers to the object representmg the current module. exports is a key of the module object: the correspondmg value of which is an object. The default value of
module.exports object is { } (empty object). You can check this by logging the value of module keyword inside any module. Let's check what is the value of module parameter inside the circle
module. Notice that there is a console.log(module); statement at the end of the code in the file given above. When you see the output. It Ivill log the module object, v,'hich has a key named
exports and the value correspondmg to this key is { } (an empty object). Now: what does the module.exports object do? Well: it is used for defining stuff that can be exported by a module.
u•hatever is exported from a module can: m turn: be made available to other modules. Exporting somethmg is quite easy. You just need to add It to the module.exports object. There are three
ways to add somethmg to the module.exports object to be exported. Let's discuss these methods one by one.
